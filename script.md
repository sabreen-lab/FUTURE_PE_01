# YouTube Script — Cybersecurity Habits for CS Students

Intro  
Hello — I’m Sabreen. If you’re studying computer science, you already know how important technical skills are. What’s often overlooked is the daily security habits that protect your work, accounts, and future career. In this video I’ll cover five practical, easy-to-adopt cybersecurity habits you can start using today.

Hook  
A single compromised account can leak code, ruin grades, or damage job prospects. The good news: most risks are avoidable with consistent habits.

Point 1 — Strong passwords + manager  
Use long, unique passwords for important accounts and store them in a password manager. Don’t rely on memory or browser-saved passwords for critical accounts like email, GitHub, or your college portal. Recommended managers include Bitwarden or 1Password.

Action: create a strong master password and enable recovery options.

Point 2 — Enable MFA  
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is the single most effective control after passwords. Use app-based authenticators (Authy, Google Authenticator) or hardware keys for high-value accounts. Avoid SMS for critical services.  
[ON SCREEN: “Enable MFA”]  
Action: enable MFA on email, GitHub, cloud accounts, and any platform with code access.

Point 3 — Secure your development environment  
Keep your system and dev tools updated. Use isolated environments — containers or VMs — when testing unknown code. Never store secrets in plain text or commit credentials to Git.  
[ON SCREEN: “Never commit secrets”]  
Action: add `.env` to `.gitignore` and check `git status` before pushing.

Point 4 — Public Wi-Fi & backups  
Avoid sensitive work on public Wi-Fi without a VPN. Maintain regular backups of important projects — encrypted if possible.

Action: set up automated backups and test your restore.

Point 5 — Mindful sharing  
Be careful what you share publicly: screenshots, repos, logs. Private repos for early work. Scrub secrets before posting.

Action: check dependencies and stick to maintained packages.
