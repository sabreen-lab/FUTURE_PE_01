### Prompt 2 — Create Outline
"Create a detailed outline for the chosen title: intro (hook + problem), 5 main points (each with 2 sub-points), actionable takeaway, and CTA. Keep total script length ~900–1000 words."

**Output:**

**Intro**
- Quick hook about why CS students are targeted  
- The issue: weak security habits, reused passwords, unsafe setups

**Point 1 — Password Manager**
- Why reused passwords are risky  
- Why a password manager solves this

**Point 2 — MFA**
- Passwords alone are not enough  
- Best types of MFA for students

**Point 3 — Secure Dev Environment**
- Keep systems updated  
- Don’t store secrets in plain text or Git

**Point 4 — Public Wi-Fi + Backups**
- Why public Wi-Fi is unsafe  
- Importance of backups for projects

**Point 5 — Mindful Sharing / Supply Chain**
- Screenshots and repos can leak data

### Prompt 3 — Generate Full Script
"Write a conversational but professional 900–1,000 word YouTube script for the outline. Use short paragraphs for easy narration, include explicit on-screen text markers like [ON SCREEN: X], and suggest B-roll for each section."

**Output:**
(A shorter version here since you already have the full script in script.md — use the full one there. This output is the summary for your chain.)

Generated a ~950-word script covering:
- Intro explaining why CS students need basic security habits  
- 5 detailed sections:
  - password manager  
  - MFA  
  - secure development environment  
  - backups + public Wi-Fi safety  
  - mindful sharing of code/logs  
- Includes on-screen highlights: “Use a password manager”, “Enable MFA”, “Never commit secrets”, “Backup + VPN”, “Scrub before sharing”  
- Includes B-roll ideas: typing shots, GitHub pages, code editors, authenticator apps, terminal windows  
- Ends with a checklist + CTA

### Prompt 4 — Storyboard
"From the script, produce a 6-frame storyboard: for each frame give shot type (close-up, screen capture, b-roll), on-screen text, and suggested B-roll clips."

**Output:**
- Frame 1: Intro — laptop close-up, title on screen  
- Frame 2: Password manager — password manager UI  
- Frame 3: MFA — authenticator app shot  
- Frame 4: Secure dev environment — VS Code + terminal
